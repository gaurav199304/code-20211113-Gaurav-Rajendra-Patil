BMI Calculator

To calculate BMI and adding extra columns in the table I have used pyspark.

The code is able to read the file data.txt which contains json data, after reading the data it calculates BMI for the person and also gives info about the risk and category.

to run the code use below command.

spark-submit bmical.py
